### Sometimes you just need to write.

I stopped thinking about writing as a chore when I realized I needed to free my form. Long form is awesome but I felt like I owed it something. It had to be epic, edited, lengthy, thorough in the extreme. Some pieces do. Most don't.

I realized the terror of the blank page kept me from something I've been doing my whole life and desperately needed.

So I've stopped caring about form and editing for awhile and will just write. It might be messy for awhile, but so it is when you cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war.
