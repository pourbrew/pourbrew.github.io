### The New Year is always a time of hope and rebirth. This year feels particularly pregnant with promise. ###

New things are growing on the work front, cash flow is solid, timing for finding our own place is established, bar study is cranking, life seems very stable and peaceful. It's a good place to be.

Here's what I have planned for this year:

#### Weekly Confession

Yeah, so I'm Catholic. Eastern Rite. The dudes w/huge beards and lots of minor key chants. Confession is an often misunderstood piece of Catholicism, methinks. Many (even many Catholics) view it as a "sin reporting exercise" where you go and mumble things you feel you have to 'fess up through a metal screen. It can be that. But it can also be a fantasic source of wisdom and mentorship, if done with that in mind. Of course, absolution is the core of the sacrament, but the human externals are nearly as important in my mind. It is hard to change behavior if you don't have the tools to do so. So yeah, I'd like to work this into a weekly routine for a better me.

#### Fit, healthy lifestyle: running + cycling + swimming routines and some good core/upper body focus

I'm starting Cross Fit. If I happen to move to an area that has solid pilates and yoga I might switch to that instead, but in the meantime I'm stoked for a core and upper body routine I can add to my baby running schedule. Working cycling back in to my cross-training routine will be huge too. Hoping to rock a tri sometime this year.

#### Grow and maintain an awesome beard

I accidentally trimmed off about an inch of beard a week ago. It was pretty tragic. I like having one and think I'll keep it year-round. There are a host of solid reasons for owning one.

#### Read a long book a month

I've been reading [The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains] (http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127370598) and it's confirmed in me the desire to combat the heavy internet usage inherent to my work.

#### Stick to the 40-hour work week

Last year was really good, but the wife had to suffer through many long days and weeks where I was working eighty to hundred-twenty hour weeks. It wasn't good, didn't help things, and stressed out our lives. Sticking to sane 40-hour work weeks and maintaining a solid work routine is vital for life. Luckily, through trial and error and the help of [Remote](http://37signals.com/remote/) and [Manage Your Day-to-Day](http://99u.com/book/manage-your-day-to-day-2).

#### Take Fizzy to $50k/month recurring revenue

Ambitious, but we're gathering an insane team, already working with incredible clients, and primed for future growth. Last year saw some huge gains for Fizzy across the board: from client and revenue growth, to project management and ability increases. It's going to be a wild year.
