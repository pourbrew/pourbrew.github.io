### How to study for the Washington State Bar Exam while growing a web development company. ###

[Kaplan Washington Bar Prep](http://www.kaptest.com/Bar-Exam/Bar-Review-Courses/General-Bar-Review/complete-washington-bar-review-course.html) recommends eight hours of study a day. Fizzy Inc has a full portfolio of client work and we're deep in the process of shifting our model from contract-based income to retainer-based income through becoming a [Hubspot Partner](http://www.hubspot.com/partners). It is a busy time.

Yet despite the workload, I won't settle for "coping," this period is a time for life as much as any other. So, here's how I do it.

##### Solid Routine #####

I wake every morning at five. I've laid my clothes out the day before so I'm not tempted to crawl under a blanket to escape the cold. About a half-hour of exercise, shower, and a lovely slowpour of single origin beans. Then into the grind.

I break the day into six ninety minute increments with fifteen minute breaks between them using [Focus Booster](http://www.focusboosterapp.com/). I do my best to alternate between work and study, because of the difference between them the one is a break from the other and vise versa.

##### Environment Shift #####

Two days a week I head in to Pioneer Square to work at my co-working space the [Impact Hub](http://hubsea.com/). Occasionnaly as well, I'll stop by one of my four favorite coffee shops and work there all day. Changing up environments is vital for keeping my mind engaged. If find that if I stay in one place too long I become creatively drained and end up frittering away my time on low-priority tasks. The energy around me helps me stay focused.

##### Exercise #####

This is the hardest element for me. I always tend to neglect my running, cycling, and yoga when I'm busy. Inevitably, neglecting exercise leads to lethargy, mental slowness, and insomnia. It's terrible and happens without fail if I don't exercise. It's a bitter balance. Countering it takes a three-fold approach: first, I begin each morning with a half-hour or so of to-exhaustion calisthenics. Pushups, plank, chinups, and stretching/yoga. Second, during my fifteen minute breaks I get up and walk around or have a wee dance party. Third, you know that afternoon stretch period after lunch when time seems to ooze by? Yeah, that's when you go for a run or a cycle. During the winter it's warmest then anyway and if you rock out a good run you won't feel bad about a brief nap afterwards. (Who knows, you might not need it afterwards)

##### Family Time #####

My wife and daughter are the primary reason I work and spending time with them is my great joy. When I'm wrapped up in work it's easy to forget and close myself off to them, but playing blocks with or reading a book to my daughter and having a conversation or giving a backrub to my wife is the perfect break from a demanding workload. It reminds me I'm human.
