Starting with what I want to do, blending with what we're good at, mixing up with a bit of customer reviews, and shaking hard.

Here's what we got:
*  Front End Web Dev (HTML5 + CSS)
*  Back End Web Dev (PHP + Javascript + jQuery)
*  Design (Typography + Minimal + Photography)
*  Reworking Existing Sites
*  Optimization
*  Hosting (Regular + Pro(CloudFlare + better response time + higher frequency backups))
