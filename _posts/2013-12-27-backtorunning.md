### I've run marathons. I've run for hours without even thinking about it. ###

I find great joy and recreation in wandering around cities and trails at a steady pace, wondering, pondering, and absorbing new sights, sounds, and smells. It's cathartic.

Unfortunately, running is the first thing to go when I'm stressed and under the gun. I always marvel that the thing that can keep me sane through the occasional few weeks of 10-12 hour days goes first. All this to say, I've been remiss the last five months and haven't run much, if at all. Physique and form have returned to pre-runner status and the holidays didn't help things.

About two weeks ago I've finally freed up the time to run regularly on my three-days-a-week schedule using the [Run Less, Run Faster](http://amzn.com/1609618025) method. It's been hard. Hard because I'm jiggly and heavy. Hard because seven miles takes me an hour and a half instead of 42 minutes. Hard because it takes so long to get back into the shape I was.

Habits are like that I suppose. I'd like to bottle these emotions and memories to uncork on occasions when I'm fit and decide not to do that run...
