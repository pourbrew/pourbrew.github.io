### My mind just makes lists. If I don't write them down, they spin around the track in my head. ###

Around and around. Interrupting whatever I'm supposed to be focusing on. So I download this data to a precisely kept notebook. A notebook kept in the fashion of [Bullet Journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/). Capturing all these thoughts in an organized way enables me to prioritize the random task generation machine in my mind. I've found that setting aside time for list-making at the end of the day has proven incredibly productive as well. Wrapping up the tasks of the day and the things to be done the next allows me to completely disengage from work. I have everything captured, I don't have to expend bandwidth post-work ensuring I dotted every "i" and crossed every "t".

It's a huge relief. Do it.
