Starting with what I want to do, blending with what we're good at, mixing up with a bit of customer reviews, and shaking hard.

Here's what we got:
<li>Front End Web Dev (HTML5 + CSS)</li>
<li>Back End Web Dev (PHP + Javascript + jQuery)</li>
<li>Design (Typography + Minimal + Photography)</li>
<li>Reworking Existing Sites</li>
<li>Optimization</li>
<li>Hosting (Regular + Pro(CloudFlare + better response time + higher frequency backups))</li>
<li>Traffic Generation</li>
<li>Lead Generation</li>
<li>Convert Leads to Customers</li>
<li>Return on Investment Analysis</li>
