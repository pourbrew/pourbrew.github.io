### Slowpour is more than coffee. ###

It's a way of life. That fifteen to twenty minutes every morning is more important to me than actually drinking the coffee. It's something organic that I have to respect and work with to bring to excellence. The slightly different grinds, water temperatures, bean to water ratios, and brew methods all vary slightly to bring out the best in a particular roast and varietal.
Morning dark is one of my favorite things. I have preternaturally good night vision so I rarely turn on lights, shower in the dark, and only turn on a desk lamp to make coffee. Slowly the sky brightens as I work, sipping the warm, rich black life into my bones.
