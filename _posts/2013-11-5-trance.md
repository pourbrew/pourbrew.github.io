### Drowning out the chatter at 138bpm. ###

I find quiet by sitting in a busy coffee shop or "plugging in" to one of the many brilliant artists making trance or progressive and sharing on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/taylor-black-2). No matter how scattered and unfocused I may be, a half hour of continous flow never fails to bring me to a place of deep focus and joy. I'm not sure how it works. Perhaps it's my subconscious mind becomes wrapped up with the continuous flow, letting my conscious mind operate specifically on the task at hand. I like to think it's the language of the universe.
