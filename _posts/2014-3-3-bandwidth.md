I wake up and it's on my mind. It doesn't go away even when I'm tired or working on something else.

### It is an awesome and terrible thing. ###

On the one hand, it's typical of intellectual endeavors. To quote my favorite philosopher:

> Deep within us all, emergent when the noise of other appetites is stilled, there is a drive to know, to understand, to see why, to discover the reason, to find the cause, to explain. Just what is wanted has many names. In what precisely it consists is a matter of dispute. But the fact of inquiry is beyond all doubt. It can absorb a man. It can keep him for hours, day after day, year after year, in the narrow prison of his study or his laboratory. It can send him on dangerous voyages of exploration. It can withdraw him from other interests, other pursuits, other pleasures, other achievements. It can fill his waking thoughts, hide from him the world of ordinary affairs, invade the very fabric of his dreams. It can demand endless sacrifices that are made without regret though there is only the hope, never a certain promise, of success. What better symbol could one find for this obscure, exigent, imperious drive, than a man, naked, running, excitedly crying, "I've got it"?

Single-minded focus comes with the territory. But there is a dark side to it as well, I've discovered. Focusing on a single problem without having worked out where that problem sits in relation to your network of interests is dangerous. You can strain and break relationships, lose wild amounts of money, kill your career, and bid farewell to any semblance of health.

Over the last few years I've slowly learned from my mistakes and my insane focus periods grow shorter. I learn to recognize them earlier and reorient more quickly. Honestly, I'm not sure I would have figured it out on my own, [@renidemus](https://twitter.com/renidemus) continually pulls me out of myself and reminds me I live In Via.

Anyway, all this to say, I just came out of an intense period of study and it's good to be back. Life in 2014 just keeps getting better and I can't wait to tell you all about it day by day here.
